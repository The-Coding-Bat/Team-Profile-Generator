## Usage 
Using the command line, type in node index.js and use it to answer a series of questions that generates the HTML file. It is very easy to understand and user-friendly. You will decide the role the employee (manager, emgineer or intern) and base on your answer to that question, a series of questions pertaining to said role will be asked and upon answering all the questions, a convenient HTML file will be generated. Feel feel to change the design/layout to whatever you see fit.
## Installation 
Pull the code from github, install Inquirer usng npm install inquirer in the command line! Must have node.js for this to work!
